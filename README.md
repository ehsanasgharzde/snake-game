# Snake Game

This Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The game consists of several modules, each responsible for different aspects of the game.

## Modules

- `main.py`: The main driver for the game, sets up the game window, initializes game components, and manages the game loop.

- `scoreboard.py`: Manages and displays the player's score during gameplay and provides game-over messages.

- `snake.py`: Defines the Snake class, handles snake movement, collision detection, and extension.

- `border.py`: Draws the boundary around the game area.

- `food.py`: Manages the creation and movement of the food items that the snake needs to eat.

## How to Play

1. Run `main.py` to start the game.

2. Control the snake's movement using arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, Right.

3. Try to eat the food items to increase your score without colliding with the walls or your own tail.

4. The game ends when you collide with the wall or your own tail, and a "GAME OVER" message is displayed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in most Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Run `main.py` to start the game.



Enjoy the game!
